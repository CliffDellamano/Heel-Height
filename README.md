# Heel-Height
This is a collection of scripts for simulating various four-bar linkage designs and analyzing their mechanical properties to inform the design process.

This script attempts to obtain the optimal design of a simple four-bar linkage, given a
set of boundary conditions and factors that contribute to the optimization. In this iteration,
the linkage is intended to fit within a defined footprint for a prosthetic ankle joint 
and is optimized over a number of factors, including maximal transmission angle, larger distribution
of reaction forces, minimal anterior-posterior motion, and others.
